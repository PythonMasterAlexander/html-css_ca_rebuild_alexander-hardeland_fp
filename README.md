Rebuild of CA in html & css course on Noroff front-end Development

Teacher feedback on the original assignment grade - 5/10

Hi Alexander

The HTML is neatly written and you've used HTML5 elements which is great to see.

Unfortunately the site can't be used on a mobile device because the hamburger menu doesn't work and on mobile devices it's set to display: none. There's two ways to get a hamburger menu to work, one is using JavaScript, and the other is using the checkbox hack in CSS. https://scrimba.com/c/ceM3paHb

If you couldn't get the hamburger menu working, then just having the nav showing would have been a better option.

The blue text on the white background isn't WCAG compliant as there isn't enough contrast between the colours.

The Contact and About Us pages are quite wide. I'd suggest using a max-width and margin: auto to bring them in so they don't stretch too wide.

The hover on the nav makes all the items change size which doesn't feel right. It should just affect the item you're hovering on.

The logo doesn't link home.

There should just be one h1 per page and it should be unique for that page.

Meta descriptions and titles are unique per page which is great to see.

It's good to read about your process in the report. Hopefully with a bit more planning you'll find it easier in the semester project. On a side note, I wouldn't suggest floats for layout, and am glad to see you using Flexbox.
